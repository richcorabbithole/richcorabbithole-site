# The Voyager Golden Record: A Mixtape for the Cosmos

Imagine being asked to create a playlist that represents all of humanity. No pressure.

## The Challenge

In 1977, NASA's Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were about to leave the solar system — permanently. Carl Sagan chaired a committee tasked with an impossible question: if an alien civilization found the spacecraft, what should they learn about us?

## What Made the Cut

The Golden Record contains:

- **115 images** encoded in analog — from mathematical definitions to photos of people, animals, and landscapes
- **Greetings in 55 languages** — from ancient Sumerian to modern Wu Chinese
- **A selection of sounds** — wind, thunder, birdsong, a train, a heartbeat
- **90 minutes of music** — ranging from Bach to Chuck Berry to Javanese gamelan

## The Decisions

Every inclusion meant an exclusion. The committee had to represent an entire planet in about 2 hours of audio and 115 images. Some interesting choices:

- They included the sound of a human heartbeat
- The greetings range from formal UN-style statements to a simple "Hello from the children of planet Earth"
- No images of war or poverty were included — a deliberate choice that some found controversial

## Where Are They Now?

Both Voyagers have entered interstellar space. Voyager 1 is the most distant human-made object, about 15 billion miles from Earth. The Golden Records are expected to remain playable for over a billion years.

That mixtape will outlive everything we've ever built on this planet.

## Why This Matters

The Golden Record is a beautiful exercise in curation under constraints. It forces a question most of us never consider: what would you choose to represent *everything*?

Research depth: 3/5 — A solid exploration of the record's contents and context, with plenty more to dig into about the individual selections.
