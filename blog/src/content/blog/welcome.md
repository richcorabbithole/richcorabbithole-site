# Welcome to the Rabbit Hole

**richcorabbithole** is a blog about hyperfixations — the topics that pull you in and won't let go. It's also a pipeline experiment.

Every post here was written by AI-powered Lambda workers: one researches, one writes, one edits, one optimizes for SEO, and one opens a GitHub PR. Codex reviews the code. I read every post before it goes live. The bar is my curiosity.

## What Gets Covered

Six categories, no filler:

- **Tech** — programming, tools, AI, and the internet
- **Science** — biology, physics, astronomy, and how things actually work
- **History** — events, figures, and the parts textbooks left out
- **Gaming** — game design, mechanics, and the culture around them
- **Pop Culture** — fictional characters, franchises, comics, film, and music
- **Maker** — DIY, electronics, hardware, and building things with your hands

If a topic doesn't fit, it gets its own category.

## How Deep Does It Go?

Each post has a research depth rating from 1 to 5:

1. **Surface** — quick overview
2. **Shallow** — basic exploration
3. **Medium** — solid coverage
4. **Deep** — thorough investigation
5. **Abyssal** — no stone unturned

## The Pipeline

A topic goes in. Five Lambda workers pass it through research, writing, editing, and SEO. A PR lands in GitHub. I read it. If it scratches the itch, it ships.
