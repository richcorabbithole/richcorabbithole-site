# Welcome to the Rabbit Hole

This is the beginning of something interesting. **richcorabbithole** is a blog dedicated to exploring the things that capture my attention - those deep dives into topics that keep you up at night, reading just one more article, watching just one more video.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a wide range of topics across different categories:

- **Tech**: Programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies
- **Science**: Fascinating discoveries and explanations of how things work
- **History**: Historical events, figures, and forgotten stories
- **Gaming**: Game design, mechanics, and the culture around games
- **Maker**: DIY projects, electronics, and building things
- **Other**: Everything else that doesn't fit neatly into a category

## The Format

Each post will have a "research depth" rating from 1-5, indicating how deep the dive goes:

1. **Surface** - Quick overview or introduction
2. **Shallow** - Basic exploration with some details
3. **Medium** - Solid dive with good coverage
4. **Deep** - Thorough investigation with nuanced understanding
5. **Abyssal** - Exhaustive exploration leaving no stone unturned

## Built with AI Assistance

This blog is powered by an AI agent system that helps with research, writing, editing, and SEO. But the human touch - the curation, the direction, the personality - that's what makes it special.

Let's dive in! 🐰🕳️
