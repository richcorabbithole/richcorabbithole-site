# The Rabbit Hole of Mechanical Keyboards

It started innocently enough. My old keyboard was dying, and I thought I'd just pick up a new one. Three weeks and dozens of browser tabs later, I was soldering switches onto a custom PCB.

## How It Begins

You Google "best keyboard" and suddenly you're learning about switch types:

- **Linear** - Smooth all the way down (Cherry MX Red, Gateron Yellow)
- **Tactile** - A bump partway through the press (Cherry MX Brown, Holy Pandas)
- **Clicky** - Tactile bump plus an audible click (Cherry MX Blue, Kailh Box White)

## Then It Escalates

Before you know it, you're watching sound tests at 2am, debating PBT vs ABS keycaps, and considering whether a 65% or 75% layout is the right choice. You learn words like "thock" and "clack" and develop strong opinions about stabilizers.

## The Build

My first custom build:

1. **PCB**: Hot-swappable so I could experiment with switches
2. **Switches**: Gateron Oil Kings, lubed with Krytox 205g0
3. **Keycaps**: PBT dye-sub in a retro colorway
4. **Case**: Aluminum with silicone dampening

Was it overkill for typing emails? Absolutely. Was it worth every minute of research? Without question.

## Lessons Learned

The mechanical keyboard hobby teaches you something important: there's incredible depth hiding in everyday objects. A keyboard is just a tool — until you realize the engineering, materials science, and community behind it.

Research depth: 4/5 — I went deep but stopped short of designing my own PCB. *For now.*
